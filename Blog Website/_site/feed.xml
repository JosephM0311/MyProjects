        <title>Best Gift Ever</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/ProfilePic.png&quot; alt=&quot;ProfilePic&quot; /&gt; Call me a &lt;strong&gt;loser&lt;/strong&gt;, but this is the best gift I have ever received &lt;em&gt;(yeah the card does not beat this one)&lt;/em&gt;. It makes me proud to be your boyfriend and glad that you are an artist because of how talented you are in creating these beautiful drawings. The fact that you spent so much time and effort drawing us together in your cute little art style makes my heart &lt;em&gt;flutter&lt;/em&gt; every time I look at my discord profile picture so &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt; for this wonderful gift :D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yes, I deadass could not tell...</description>

        <title>The Start (2022-10-29)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/love4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;love4&quot; /&gt; This is the first photo we have ever taken together of just us two and I like to think of it as our “&lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt;”. This was the day of Evelyn’s birthday, when I first introduced you to my friends, and I was so relieved to see that you and my friends got along with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would say that this was our first “date” because it was the first time we actually did a fun activity together &lt;em&gt;(unless you count Key Club as fun D:)&lt;/em&gt; so this day is especially memorable. We went rollerblading first...</description>

        <title>Sunset Park (2023-01-01)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/love2.png&quot; alt=&quot;love2&quot; /&gt; So much happened on this day that I do not even know where to begin. This was during &lt;strong&gt;New Years&lt;/strong&gt;, so rather than spending time with our family making New Years Resolutions, we three overgrown children decided to wreak havoc upon a friendly neighborhood park :D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, we met at the Kings Highway train station early in the morning, at which Angelina proceeded in kicking me as usual. We then went to &lt;strong&gt;Greenwood Cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; to sightsee, but the view was quite gloomy because of all the dead trees and frozen lakes due to...</description>

        <title>Subway Surfers (2022-12-09)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/love3.png&quot; alt=&quot;love3&quot; /&gt; This is one of the first subway pictures we have ever taken together, and it makes me happy seeing how far we have come since then. This was taken after our little journey to the &lt;strong&gt;Great Irish Potato Famine Memorial&lt;/strong&gt; for you Hanna extra credit, and I remember thinking how cute you were for being shy in taking the selfie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry that I do not remember more about this day, but I thought this photo of us together was very cute &lt;em&gt;(mainly because of you)&lt;/em&gt;, and I hope you agree as well :D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;...</description>

        <title>Karaoke Time (2023-02-20)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/love0.png&quot; alt=&quot;love0&quot; /&gt; I mean…what can I say? Singing karaoke with you was really fun and I definitely felt less awkward singing on this day than before. It was very nice to vibe in the private room and sing along to songs or just listen to your singing beside you because of how calming it is to be alone with you in our own little private world in the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will not mention the other &lt;strong&gt;part&lt;/strong&gt; of this, but I really enjoy all the time I spend with you. This photo of us together is really cute &lt;em&gt;(it’s...</description>

If I could, I would make this my instagram profile picture, slather it on all of my social medias, and praise it like the next Mona Lisa. The lighting on this photo is absolutely fantastic, and the quality is just spectacular &lt;em&gt;(I really need to give my phone some more love)&lt;/em&gt;. Your hair looks beautiful here &lt;em&gt;(I really like the hair strands covering your eye)&lt;/em&gt;, and we both look so comfy with our hoods and jackets on during this winter day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, enough...</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit #1: Eskimo posing with bunny ears on a depressing pathway with a busy Manhattan intersection in the background.&lt;/strong&gt;

        <title>Comfy Subway (2023-01-15)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/uploads/love1.png&quot; alt=&quot;love1&quot; /&gt; When I came across this photo while looking back at our album, I was wowed by how good its quality is. I do not remember this subway ride that well, but we looked very comfy together snuggling and cuddling in public :D. The lighting looks very nice, you look amazing as always, and the positioning of our heads is spot on, making this one of my favorite photos of us together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; do mean it when I say you look really nice without your glasses, which does not mean you are unattractive with glasses...</description>
